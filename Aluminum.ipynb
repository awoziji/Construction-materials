Recycling aluminum only uses 5% of the energy needed to produce aluminum from bauxite ore. This results in a substantial reduction in greenhouse gases. Additionally, the majority of the aluminum in the world is produced using power produced by hydroelectric facilities. Though these have an environmental impact of their own, dams are considered a renewable source of power. Currently about 65% of aluminum is recycled in the United States and world wide 35% of all aluminum production comes from recycled material ([source](http://recycling.world-aluminium.org/review/sustainability.html)).  Due to the long life span of most construction projects only about 8% of recycled aluminum is currently coming from construction salvage. \n",

Products like aluminum siding could be reused but it is difficult to remove it in a reusable condition.  Aluminum wire should not be reused if it has been removed from a structure.  The reason for this is related to fatigue.  Unlike steel aluminum does not have a lower fatigue limit.  In other words, not mater how big the piece of aluminum is or how small the cycled load is aluminum will eventually fail due to fatigue.  That is not saying that it cannot be used effectively in construction but its exposure to repeated loading should be considered when thinking about a particular application.  \n",

    "When examining a fatigue failure in aluminum part of the surface will be dark where the crack was and part of it will be bright where the final fracture occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is interesting to note that most commercial aircraft often have aluminum skin and this skin has failed before due to fatigue. The load cycling which has causes failure was due to the repeated pressurization and de-pressurization of the aircraft cabin. In original airplane design the windows were not round but rather they were square. This unfortunately lead to [stress concentrations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_concentration) at the corners which in turn lead to fatigue cracking. It is also interesting to note that the method used to stop the propagation of fatigue cracking is drilling a hole at the end of the crack. The round hole reduces the level of stress concentration at the tip of the crack which then increases the fatigue lifespan of the remaining material."

These include riveting, stitching, interlocking joints, brazing, soldering, and adhesive bonding.  Various versions of these types of joints are commonly seen in ductwork on construction sites.  The particular joint used depends on the specific application and the resulting strength of the joint must be verified so that it is not the weak point in the element.

    "Aluminum can begin to lose its protective oxide coating above $530 ^\\circ F$ and will melt at around $1,200 ^\\circ F$.  Aluminum is actually highly reactive with oxygen but the oxide that it forms will bond with and shield the main body of aluminum.  Aluminum is so highly reactive it is used in some rocket fuels.  Since better materials are available for working at high temperatures so it should only be used below $400 - 500 ^\\circ F$.  \n",

    "Aluminum also expands nearly twice as much as steel when subjected to temperature variations.  This means that differential expansion between aluminum and what ever it is connected to needs to be allowed for.  This is easy enough to do in design but it does need to be considered.  If it is not allowed for then if aluminum pieces are connected to each other and a separate, more stable, surface, then the aluminum pieces are likely to be pulled apart by moderate temperature changes.\n",

    "Aluminum is sold in many shapes and sizes.  It can come in the form of sheets, tubes, extruded parts, and nails among others.  The prices of each of these are dependent on the raw material cost of aluminum but are also strongly dependent on the working process needed to form the final product.  There is not a good rule of thumb that can be used in estimating prices of aluminum products in this case.  Just as a counter example you might think that aluminum flashing would be more expensive than steel flashing.  On average you might find a roll of aluminum flashing (16\"x50') for \\$51.40 but that is not substantially more than the average price for the same size roll in steel, \\$50.10.  The reason the prices are so close is that less aluminum is necessary to achieve a comparable durability.\n",

The plane suffered explosive decompression when an 18 foot long section of the fuselage separated from the aircraft.  The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) concluded that the accident was caused by metal fatigue exacerbated by [crevice corrosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crevice_corrosion). The plane was operated in an environment where it was repeatedly exposed to salt and humidity.  Additionally a passenger boarding the plane noticed a crack in the fuselage but failed to report it.  Despite the substantial damage to the aircraft only one person died.\n",
