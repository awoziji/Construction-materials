    "Now that you have become familure with how to navigate the online lectures of this course, I'm going to give you a few tips to allow you to be successful in this and other courses with online lecture material.\n",
    "\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li>Take notes</li>\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "    <li>Taking notes in a notebook is how you have learned thoughout your entire accedemic carrer and on-line courses are no different.  You brain has now been trained to equate note taking with learning; if you don't take notes you will be at a significant disadvantage.</li>\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "<li>Keep a schedule</li>\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "    <li>Do not let the fact that you can view the lectures at anytime lull you into a false sense of security.  You need to maintane the self displine necessary to not fall behind in the course.  This could have also fit under the <strong>Take notes</strong> point since it is also important that you be able to remember the information from the lectures without access to the internet.</li>\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "<li>Show up to classs</li>\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "    <li>You will find, as in many portions of life, if you simple show up you have accomplished 50% of the job.  When ever we are scheduled to meet you need to be there.  I may or may not take attendance because you are now adults and I am not a baby sitter.  However, I may give a quiz or answers to an assignment.  If you don't show up you will not have an opertunity to ask questions, and I do not record my live lectures.</li>\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "<li>Stay active in the class</li>\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "    <li>There is a temptation to simply hide behind the screen and only do what you are told.  The students that do well in courses with on-line content make a point to engage other students in discussions.  There is a class discussion page and it is a good idea to post questions, answer other peoples questions, and read the comments there atleast a couple times a week.  I'm not saying to poost the solution to assignments there but if you have any tips or hints for other students who might be struggeling make sure you share.  You might have questions of your own in the future and someone you help today may help you tomorrow.</li>\n",
    "    <li>I will frequent the discussion board and make sure the language, tone and information are all appropreate for university students.  This will likely come into play in the class participation part of your grade.</li>\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "<li>An education is a privledge</li>\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "    <li>I have been working with Engineers without Borders for the last couple years and I know there is no way I can convey to you just how privledged you are to be able to be attending college.  Ninety-three percent of the people in the world do not have a college degree and seventy-eight percent do not have access to any sort of computer.<sup><a href=\"http://www.100people.org/statistics_100stats.php?section=statistics\">[1]</a></sup> There are a lot of people out there who do not have access to safe drinking water or even a bed.  You have an opertunity to not only live a luxurious life but also learn how to maintain that lifestyle and even provide an opertunity for your children to do so as well.  You will also get the opertunity through your education and future carreer to help the people who are not in your place right now.  Try to make the most of the opertunities you have been given.  If not for your own sake then for the others you may get to help in the future.</li>\n",
