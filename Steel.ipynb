There is a failure mode known as fatigue.  This is where a piece of material is loaded below the failure limit (or endurance limit) but loaded repeatedly. This repeated loading can cause the growth of micro fractures and eventually lead to failure.  This can occur with loading even lower than half the maximum as long as it is repeated enough.  However, with steel there is a lower limit of loading where it can be loaded repeatedly, forever, with no rish of failure.\n",

It is mainly comprised of iron and carbon atoms (a maximum of 2.0% by weight) aranged in a series of interlocking grains formed from metallic crystals.  Steel alloys may contain other elements like tungsten, cobalt, nickel, chromium, manganese and even (more recently) aluminium.  These allows result in modifications in the strength, stiffness, density, corrosion resistance, hardness, or the attraction to magnets among others.  There have been thousands of varieties of steel developed to meet specific needs.\n",

    "In the construction industry we are mainly interested in the steel used in bars, beams, girders, trusses, fasteners and cables.  These are item used to resist loads in building construction.  Most sturctural steel sections are formed from large castings and are reduced in size, elongated and shaped by rolling.  The temerature at which these rollings take place have a great effect on the final properties of the element.  The structural steel that were concern ourselves with will have carbon content that is generally less than 0.30%.\n",

Welding can create connections that are stronger than are possible using bolts.  It also reduces the size of the members at these connections.  Welding allows for the creations of continous pieces that would otherwise be impossible to produce.\n",

    "As we have see previously the ability of steel to resist strain can depend on the amount of strain the steel has undergone.  The red curve is more representive of the behavior of an actual sample.  It is also called the \"engineering\" stress-strain relationship.  It is called that since it reflects the engineering properties of a particular sample.  \n",
    "\n",
    "OK, that isn't really clear.  Engineering stress-strain is found by taking a clynderical sample of the material (steel in this case) and first measuring the cross sectional area of the sample then applying tension to it and recording the responce.  The stress is calculated by dividing the applied tension to the original cross seectional area of the sample.  This is in contrast to the dark blue line which is the true stress-strain relationship.\n",

The reason there is a difference between the true and engineering stress-strain curves is due to something called necking.  As tension is applied to a ductile sample it starts to pull apart, like taffy or gum.  This causes a reduction in the diameter of the sample and a reduction of the true cross sectional area.  The \"true\" stress-strain curve has its stress calculated by dividing the tension force by the actual cross sectional area.  When the reduction in area is accounted for then the strength of steel can be seen to generally only go up with additional strain.  This is actually one process that is used to create high strength wire.  The steel is drawing through a small dye and process of reducing the cross sectional area results in a wire that has higher strength than the original steel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Back to the original stress-strain curve.  We'll look at the engineering curve since that is representive of the behavior of a finshed steel element.  We see that the yield point (#2) is slightly higher that the curve just to the right.  This means that once the yield point is reached the effective strength of the element drops and it must imediately strain much more to reach the stain hardening portion of the curve.  This is the reason that idealized curves have a straight line across in the plastic section. If a continous force is applied to the element it immetiately lengthens until it starts to strain harden.  This is what you see in the next section of the curve (#4).  The utilmate strength is reached at point #1, if the force remmains constant after that the element lenghts and fractures.  However if the force is not constant but rather it is simply a function of displacement then the element will have a reduction in carrying capacity until it reaches point #3, the fracture point.  The section of the curve where the strength is falling (#5) is where necking occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is the idealized engineering stress-strain curve for A36 steel.  The 36 in the designation refers to the $36,000 ksi$ at the yield point on the stress-strain curve.  Aditionally, since you cannot rely on any strength beyond the ultimate strength, it is often not shown on the curve."

    "I haven't mentioned this prior to now but this curve is just the responce to the sample being placed in tension.  The reason this is generally what you see is that generally there are established relationships between the strength of a material in tension and other failure modes.  That way a single value like the $58 ksi$ ultimate tensions strength of A36 steel can be converted into $43.5 ksi$ ultimate shear strength.  These relationships vary from one material to the next based on the internal structure of the material but a simple conversion factor is almost always availble.\n",

    "Steel will fail if it is subjected to excessive tension, shear, compression, or torsion and the loads at which failure will occur are dependent upon other considerations like the duration of the load, the temperature of the materail, electrical activity in the material, and the chemistry of the surrounding environment.  If the wrong type of steel is used in a caustic environment it will begin to disolve and thereby reduce the cross section available to resist the applied load.\n",

The effects of a particular load will vary based on how much time the atoms in the material have to adjust and rearrange while the load is being applied.  Since we know that atoms move more quickly when they are hotter it is like time is moving more quickly for them reletive to an applied load. Conversely when the atoms are colder then it is like time is moving slowly relative to an applied load.  Now imagine that you hit a flower laying on a table with a hammer.  You would expect it to flatten and be crushed but intact for the most part.  Now imagine that same flower being hit with a hammer after the flower was dipped in liquid nitrogen.  The flower shatters instead of crushing.  In this case the water in the cells of the flower has crystalized and so the molecules of water cannot move relative to each other.  Previously, though difficult, the water did move around in the structure of the flower in such a way as to redistribute the force of the hammer blow equally.  Once it was frozen the water did not have time to redistribute the force of the imact and it turn each crystal was required to resist the entire force of the blow.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This analogy works since at the microscopic scale steel is made up of small crystals.  In a material the is not crystaline the effect of load duration can be different and must be accounted for differently."

An oxidizer is any substance that will remove electrons in a chemical reaction from the substance that is being oxidized.  This is actually really useful to know since it means that the corrosion of steel is an electrical reaction and thus can be prevented with the proper aplication of electricity.  Some bridges and buildings are protected by applying a low level current to the steel in the structure.  Instead of the steel being corroded the electrons of the chemical reaction are supplied by a power cord.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This is not often practical so other souces of electrons are sometimes used, like a block of zinc or other sacrificial anodes.  If zinc is electrically conected to steel it will corrode instead of the steel.  The electrons are supplied by the zinc to the steel thereby preventing the chemical reaction of the steel from taking place.  This will continue as long as there is enough zinc to provide the needed elctrons.  The sacrifical anodes are periodically replaced as needed to protect the structure.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to prevent the corrosion of steel is to protect it from the sorce of corrosion.  This can mean painting it to seal it from the air but is can also mean just keeping it dry.  In order for for the chemical reaction to occur that causes rusting (steel corroding) there must be a medium for ions to travel in.  This medium is generally water.  So if you keep steel dry it generally won't corrode."

    "Around $2,700 F^{\\circ}$ iron, which makes up the majority of steel, begins to melt.  However steel will melt around  $2,000 - 2,400 F^{\\circ}$ depending on its carbon content.  It will begin to have reduced structural capacity at $1,000 - 1,300 F^{\\circ}$.  At this temperature the yield stress will only be about 60% of normal.  It is for this reason that critical elements need to be protected from exposure to fire.  These elements include beams and trusses that support floors or critical columns in tall structures.  If there is a fire in a steel highrise and the building collapses it is the weaking of the steel that will be the source of the failure not that the steel burned.  The decision to fireproof a steel element will depend on the importance of the element as defined in the building code.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a lower temperature limit where steel can become brittle.  For instance QT-100 (or A514) steel has a recommended lower limit of $50 ^\\circ F$ for its safe use.  Below that it becomes brittle instead of ductile and can be subject to failure without warning.  FYI A514 steel does not have a yield strength of $514 ksi$ but rather $100 ksi$.  Steel's designation generally does not indicate the yield strength of the material.  "

This way the poitions of the test where the strength falls off can be accurately measured.  The samples typically are 2 inches long over the 0.5 inch diameter section.

Depending on the size of the steel involved you may also need access to a crane.  A relatively small beam like the 10 ft long W12x22 I mentioned previously would weigh 220 lbs; at 20 ft in length it would be 440 lbs.  The physical dimensions of the be would be only 12.25\" in height (h), 4\" in width (w), less than 0.5\" in flange thickness (t), and about 0.25\" in web thickness (b).  This would seem to be fairly small and relative to a lot of beams it is.  W44x335 beams are available which stand 44\" tall (almost 4 ft) and weight 335 lbs for every foot in length.  Either way it should be clear that for a lot of usable sizes steel sections are practically impossible to move by hand.\n",

The investigation into the collapse revealed that a single element's failure in the bridge started the collapse of the bridge.  Undersized [gusset plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gusset_plate) which had worked for 40 years finally gave out.  These plates which should have been 1 inch thick were specified to be only half of that.  The mode of failure that the gusset plates under went was a type of buckling.  Buckling strength is approximately proportional to thickness in the direction of bending to the third power, so having half the thickness meant that the gusset plate only had on eighth of the resistance to buckling."
