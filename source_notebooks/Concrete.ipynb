    "Concrete is a composite material consisting of cement and aggregate.  Once fully cured concrete is very strong in compression.  High strength concrete can resist as much as 19 ksi. This is not as much as steel but it weighs less and is much cheaper.  Additionally it is fire resistant; so much so that it is sometimes used to protect steel.  What you see in the video of a concrete cylinder being crushed (if available) is a sudden failure due to a cylinder being compressed.  However the failure is technically due to tension developed from the effect of [Poisson's ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson%27s_ratio).

    "Modern concrete was first developed in 1824 by [Joseph Aspdin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Aspdin).  The term \"Portland cement\" was coined by him since the hardened substance resembled limestone from the Isle of Portland in Dorset.  [Reinforced concrete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforced_concrete) was developed in the 1850s with a patent being issued to a French gardener named [F. Joseph Monier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Monier) in 1857.  The use of reinforcement provides a method to overcome the lack of tensile strength in unreinforced concrete."

    "The steel reinforcing bars allow for beams to crack and still be strong since the steel carried the tension.  Additional techniques include using steel cables to prestress the concrete.  Prestressing is where a member is placed in compression before being used in service.  If the prestressing is done carefully it the side of the member that was going to be in tension will be in compression.  Once the service loading is applied, the tension will just lessen the pre-applied compression and the member will remain in compression.  This will prevent any cracking from forming since the member never goes into tension.  The ultimate effect is that the concrete element is stiffer and stronger making it unnecessary to use as large an element as without prestressing.\n",

The fact that concrete cures instead of drying means that considerations need to be taken when planning on ordering from a batch plant since the cure time starts at the plant.  Additives like curing retarders can be included in the mix but they add cost and there is a limit to what they can do.
